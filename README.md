# JMeterPerformanceTestsWithTTestCases

Project Completion Report
Project Name: JMeter Performance Test Project Project Objective: To conduct various load and stress tests on the Restful Booker API, verifying whether the system performs and maintains stability under specified thresholds.

Test Summary
A total of 12 test scenarios were successfully executed. These tests were designed to evaluate the API's performance under different user loads and ensure critical functions operate seamlessly.

Test Types:

Load Test: Evaluates system behavior under 1000, 2000, and 3000 concurrent thread loads.

Stress Test: Measures API performance under maximum load within specified time frames.

Confirmation Test: Verifies the correctness of critical operations, such as the delete function.

Functions Tested:
Create Token: Ensures token generation under specific loads.

Get All Bookings: Checks the retrieval of all booking IDs under concurrent user loads.

Create A Booking: Verifies stability and functionality while creating new bookings.

Update A Booking: Ensures smooth updates to existing booking records.

Delete A Booking: Validates the functionality of deleting bookings.

Results
Function Name	Load Level	Duration	Error Rate	Status
Create Token	1000 threads	15 minutes	0%	Passed
Create Token	2000 threads	15 minutes	0%	Passed
Create Token	3000 threads	15 minutes	0%	Passed
Get All Bookings	1000 threads	15 minutes	0%	Passed
Get All Bookings	2000 threads	15 minutes	0%	Passed
Create A Booking	1000 threads	15 minutes	0%	Passed
Update A Booking	1000 threads	5 minutes	0%	Passed
Delete A Booking	1 request	Immediate	0%	Passed
All tests maintained an error rate below the acceptable threshold of 10%, demonstrating consistent and reliable system behavior.

Achievements
System Performance: The API maintained stability and functioned successfully even under high user loads.

Zero Failures: All test functions had a 0% error rate, indicating a robust and reliable system.

Comprehensive Coverage: Both low and high user loads were tested to assess system responses thoroughly.

Identified Issues and Recommendations
Test Independence: Ensure tests (like delete operations) do not impact subsequent tests by using independent data sets.

Dynamic Test Data: Replace static test data with dynamic data sets for more versatile test coverage.

Enhanced Reporting: Incorporate graphical representation tools like Allure or ExtentReports for better visualization of results.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the API's capacity to handle high user loads and maintain error-free performance. The results confirm that the system is capable of meeting production-level demands effectively.
